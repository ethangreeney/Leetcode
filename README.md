# LeetCode Solutions

My LeetCode grind in Java and C++. Done for fun as AI will be taking my job shortly.

## What's in here

I try to optimize these pretty hard - sometimes hitting that sweet `0ms, beats 100%` benchmark. For some problems I've coded up multiple approaches (iterative vs recursive, naive vs optimized, etc.) to see the tradeoffs.

Started with Java since that's what I learned first, then moved to C++ because why not make things harder. Everything's organized by topic (`TwoPointers`, `ArraysHashing`, `Trees`, etc.) so it's easier to find stuff when I inevitably forget how to solve something.
