## ✨ Key Features

*   **🚀 Performance-Tuned:** Solutions are highly optimized, aiming for (`0ms, beats 100%`) on LeetCode's benchmarks.
*   **🧠 Multiple Approaches:** For many problems, I have done multiple solutions such as iterative vs. recursive, or naive vs. optimized to illustrate various trade-offs in time and space complexity.
*   **💻 Java & C++:** Solutions are in both Java and C++, as I started learning with Java, then transitioned to C++.
*   **🗂️ Organized by Topic:** Code is neatly categorized by the primary data structure or algorithm pattern (e.g., `TwoPointers`, `ArraysHashing`, `Trees`), making it easy to find and study related problems.
