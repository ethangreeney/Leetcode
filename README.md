# LeetCode Solutions in Java

Welcome to my personal collection of LeetCode problem solutions implemented in Java. This repository serves as a way to track my progress, practice data structures and algorithms, and share my approaches to various coding challenges.

## About This Project

This project contains my Java solutions for a variety of problems from LeetCode. Each solution is organized into a package that reflects the main data structure or algorithmic technique used.

My primary goals for this repository are:
*   To solidify my understanding of common algorithms and data structures.
*   To practice writing clean and efficient Java code.
*   To have a reference for future problem-solving.

## Solved Problems

Below is a list of problems I've solved, categorized by their primary topic (derived from the package name). You can find the code within the respective package directories in this repository.
